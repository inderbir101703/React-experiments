postcss is a tool for transforming css along with js. tailwind css uses it
npx tailwindcss init --> intialzing tailwind css into our repo
tailwinf.config.css -> config for css
create .postcssrc for  config file for post css // in this file must include post css as a plugin
bundler/parcel uses postcssrc to understand tailwind


tailwind may cause the code unreadable if written too much on an element
tailwind only import that code which is required in the project
ex- if m-4 class is written 100 times in our code , only one time it will be imported by tailwind not 100 times
so it is very very light weight and keeps the bundle small
whenever we write a styling class its code will added side by sside by tailwind

different developers may add same styling under same classes so redudant classes can be there
